# Requirements
* .NET Framework 4 or later. (also works on Mono!)
* [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org)

## Dependencies
If you are a Visual Studio lover, all dependencies will be resolved automatically. So, you build this with VS, all things are done!

Otherwise (for Mono users), first, you should get NuGet client (see [NuGet's document](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget)). After that, in the solution root directory, do:

```
% mono nuget.exe restore fafrotskies.sln
```

# Usage
```
fafrotskies [--port PORT] problem_file
```
`--port` is optional. The server will listen on port 3939/tcp by default.

# Problem File
It's YAML file.

```yaml
name: Problem Name
description: |
  Problem Description here!
  Let's study elementary mathemathics!
stages:
  -
    num: 4
    clear_message: Stage 1 cleared. Flag is FLAG{STAGE_ONE}
  -
    num: 2
    enter_message: Okay! Keep goin'
  -
    num: 1
    enter_message: The LAST stage!
    clear_message: Complete! Flag is FLAG{CLEAR}
limit: 10
cases:
  -
    problem: 1+1=?
    answer: 2
  -
    problem: 3*3=?
    answer: 9
    limit: 15
```

## Time Limit
`limit` in the root hash is the default time limit, and `limit` in the cases hash is the problem specific time limit. In the above case, for case 1, the limit is 10 seconds, and for case 2, the limit is 15 seconds.

## Cases Generator
Fafrotskies can send the cases generated by the specified command instead. To delegate the case generating, change `cases` item like:
```yaml
# problem definitions...
cases:
  cmd: casegen %s
```
`%s` will be replaced with the stage number.

The generator should write the case to the standard output. The output format is the Hash of YAML, such as:

```yaml
problem: generated problem 1
answer: generated answer 1
limit: 5
```

The output should *NOT* be an array, so the following output is invalid:

```yaml
-
  problem: bad one
  answer: soooo bad!
```

## telnet Sample
```
% telnet localhost 3939
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Welcome. We are the fafrotskies.

===== problem test =====
This is the test!

#1
here is the simple equation.
do you know... 1+1=?
2
#2
okay. Let's get to the next stage.
The next is: 2+2=?
4
Congratulations!
Flag is FLAG{123456789abcdef}
Connection closed by foreign host.
